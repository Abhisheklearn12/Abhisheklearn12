# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Abhishek!  

## Learning, Building, Problem Solving, Shipping, Innovating
## Literally love C, Assembly, Rust, C++

#### My Philosophy: I deeply Respect "First Principle Thinking, Reverse engineering, Breaking down complex Idea into Super Small Actionable Ideas" and I apply these principles in my life.
### I think in systems (system thinking) is very very important in my life, everything I do with some clear system in mind.

#### ðŸ˜‡ Mine langs (that I learnt): C, Rust, C++, Go, Javascript/Typescript, Python, Zig.
#### ðŸ˜‹ Exploring deeply rn: Assembly (x86-64 with NASM (intel like syntax) and read AT&T syntax).

### Btw I use Linux OS on a regular basis, I just love to build stuffs on Linux/GNU.
#### There's literally nothing in this world, that I can't build and solve, I literally love to do this, it's my dopamine.
##### I write code that CPU and machine literally loves and I think in terms of these.
